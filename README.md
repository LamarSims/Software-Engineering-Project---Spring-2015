Software Engineering College Project from Georgia Southern University

Group Project

The purpose of the system is to provide the Georgia Southern Film Club with a useful set of tools to aid in the tasks involved within
the organization. The proposed solution is a content management system (CMS) that will provide administration over information and media
that the film club wishes to share over web pages accessible through the Internet.
